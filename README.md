# Instructions: HELPrct (Data Verbs) Activity


## Grading

- Assignment is worth a total of 10 points
- [3 points] Task 1: 
    - Data description
    - Basic summaries
- [5 points] Task 2: 
    - one point per `group_by()` prompt 
- [2 points] Task 3: 
    - one point for including a useful plot with at least 3 variables represented
    - one point for including comments


## Instructions 
- Task prompts are in *italics* in the .Rmd file
- create a new R Notebook in your team GitHub Repository
- complete the three tasks below as a team (both of you should make commits in GitHub)
- submit the completed R Notebook as .NB.HTML to Canvas before deadline


## Tips

- **always "PULL" before you do anything** when collaborating on a project controlled by GitHub to make sure you are working with the latest code (otherwise you'll have problems) 
- **always "PUSH" when you're done** so your collaborators can pull the latest version of the code.
- **always write descriptive commit messages** 
- Make sure you run all code chunks in your R Notebook before you "preview" the HTML document.  
- Make sure the .NB.HTML document that you submit to Canvas has rendered properly--the header in your .Rmd file needs to specify the output as `html_notebook` for an R Notebook (**NOT** `html_document`)
- If you want to use some of the other `xyzGraphBuilder()` functions that you learned in Chapter 5 of the book, you will need to load the `DataComputing` package
